The decision issues of Sos engineering arise in many areas such as manufacturing, defense, national security, aerospace, aeronautics, energy, environment, healthcare, and transportation. This stream proposes and facilitates interactions on the current development in the field of system of systems and system engineering, with emphasis the decision analysis in this fields. The original works of this areas are welcomed to submit their paper to this stream, especially for new theories that describe the Sos model which can make the complex system more understandable for the decision makers; new methodologies, technologies to solve the challenging decision problems during the analysis of Sos Engineering; new applications and practical advances which can utilize the performance of complex systems in the real world. The main objective of the Stream on Complex systems and Decision Analysis is to exchange ideas and experiences on technology, methodology, applications, study cases, and practical experiences such as Sos structure model, Sos analysis, Sos requirement, model-based system engineering, multi-objective decision making in Sos engineering. Original papers related to this stream are warmly welcomed.   </p>

New, recently-developed methodologies and techniques that can help analysts understand strategic conflicts and provide strategic support to negotiators have been of great benefit to many decision makers. New theoretical issues are being explored, and at the same time new software systems are making modeling easier and analytical results clearer. Theoretical and practical advances have been utilized to study strategic conflicts arising in diverse areas including energy projects, climate change, environmental management, food crisis, economic disparities, international trade and aging infrastructure. The main objective of the Stream on Conflict Resolution is to provide a forum for discussion of research advances on the development of formal approaches to conflict resolution with insightful applications in a range of domains.

                                                    <p class="bodytext">Crowdsourcing refers to a collaboration model enabled by social media technologies to solve individual, organizational, and societal problems using a dynamically formed crowd of interested people who respond to an open call for participation. Over the last decade, crowdsourcing has grown as a viable and popular form of mass collaboration beyond organizational boundaries. Organizations use different crowdsourcing models, such as micro tasking, labor markets, open innovation, innovation competitions, citizen science, community crowdsourcing, enterprise/intra-organizational crowdsourcing, and crowd funding.

First, these are the issues on the disputable zones in the Arctic region, revealing the interests of countries and of local population over these zones.</p>

We would like to reveal those problems and discuss the role of communities in the group decisions. We will discuss the models dealing with collective and  multi-criterial decisions, and special attention will be given to optimization models and models taking into account, in particular, conditions of poor information.</p>
                                                    <p class="bodytext">Second, we are going to discuss the problems of perception and judgement of decisions made, in particular, how these perceptions and judgments are distributed and spread over local communities in the region. An experimental studies revealing these perceptions and judgments will be a part on our stream. </p>

GDN2018 invites further research to explore the following questions:  How do emotions influence the framing of decision problems, the negotiation dynamics/process/outcome/evaluation, and vice versa? How are emotions expressed, elicited and interpreted depending on contexts such as culture, participants relations/personality, activity, stress level, etc.? Are emotions coping strategies in group decision and negotiation? How are emotions related to the different stages of negotiation? What are the neural conditions and functions of emotions in group decision and negotiation? How does inter-subjectivity affect emotions? What are the communicative means for the realization of emotions? How are emotion related to multi-functionality of utterances? How can that multi-functionality be reflected in the architecture of Decision Support Systems? How are emotions related to value, ideology and identity? Are there different cultural aspects of emotions? How do different types of media affect emotions in group decision and negotiation contexts? Can we develop fully Automated Decision Support and Negotiation Agents which take into consideration emotion at each stage? Can Mind-Minding Virtual Humans facilitate the group decision or negotiation processes and problem formulation? What novel methods are developed for the study of how emotions affect the process and outcome of group decision and negotiation?

New issues are being proposed and new models and techniques have been developed to support researches on them. Focusing on the sustainable development and economic efficiency of governments, researchers have tried to model the climate change, technical change, as well as the whole ‘3E’ systems to offer implications for governments in policy design and international negotiations.  Investors usually have interests in the strategic decisions in investments in energy projects, carbon mitigation technologies, sustainable operations, etc. This stream aims to provide a forum for researchers, scientists, and practitioners working on clarifying the relationship between groups with different objectives, evaluating the ‘3E’ systems and their developments, and providing decision strategies for different groups.

                                                    <p class="bodytext">Mega infrastructure projects (MIPs) are generally a type of projects which involve the governments as the major decision-makers and investors. They usually have huge scales, and are characterized by complex environmental conditions and their significant and far-reaching impacts on the social and economic developments of a region.At present, the successful delivery of MIPs has been recognized as the important driving force and the symbol of economic and social development throughout the world. Moreover, the importance and complexity of decision-making in MIPs have also become increasingly apparent.
                                                    
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="bodytext">The decision-making in MIPs refers to the analysis of complex decision-making difficulties and the selection of plans, including the project approval, the construction plan, the mode of investment and financing, etc. The decision-making consists of a wide range of related components, especially the complicated decision-making group which is composed of multi-level, cross-border and multi-autonomous organizations. In the decision-making process, it is not only necessary to analyze and handle the conflicts and coordination among different preferences, interests and values of different bodies, but also pay attention to the important features that the major decision makers have a high social level and their own political, legal, power and cultural attributes are distinctive.
                                                    
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="bodytext">Therefore, in addition to solving the general group decision-making optimization and value preference coordination, the decision group in MIPs must properly solve the conflicts between power and law, and the system design of the group decision-making. It means the group decision-making in MIPs is not only a new issue of group decision-making that is currently of wide practical significance in the world, but also an academic extension of the traditional research on group decision science and theory.

                                                    <p class="bodytext">Negotiation theory and humanitarian practice can learn much from each other. First, humanitarian practitioners and organizations increasingly recognize the importance of negotiation and mediation approaches to save lives, to provide protection and to deliver assistance. However they have little contact with negotiation experts and little knowledge about theoretical models that can inform their daily practice. Second, negotiation academics have not much studied what is specific about humanitarian work. Their prevailing theories, including the interest-based negotiation, might not suffice to overcome many challenges and dilemmas that humanitarians face daily. This double ignorance of negotiation theory and humanitarian practice, by each other, can be replaced by mutual nurturing. Humanitarian practice can even support alternative approaches to mainstream theory. Negotiation theory, as it becomes more pluralistic and inquiry-based, can also inform humanitarian practice.  From the 19th century until today, the history of humanitarian diplomacy provides many cases to examine, with successes and failures of multifold negotiations. Humanitarian negotiation becomes ever more complex, with more stakeholders, more problems and more processes to take into account. Complementary theories, tools and concepts can be elaborated, which will help frontline negotiators in the field, but which in turn will question and refine the theories themselves.

Cognitive issues, formal knowledge and skills of DMs influence the redesigning of existing and designing the new methods for preference modeling and elicitation for group decision and negotiation (GDN) process. In order to make these methods more appropriate for real-world decision problems, preference modeling approaches need to be continuously improved, considering behavioral issues and DMs’ limitations regarding information and perception for evaluating preferences.

Most of the time data need validation, collation, and structuralisation. Well-structured, correctly analyzed at the right time, data will help in choosing priorities, detecting threats and finding ways of development. Meanwhile, many decisions are still made under uncertainty and without proper risk management. Series of recent economic crises in the mix with technogenic catastrophes and natural disasters point out the needs of developing cutting edge approaches and strategies for designing state-of-the-art tools and methods in supporting decisions. The stream is intending to provide space for exploring new ideas, concepts and investigations on the theme “Risk Analytics and Data Intelligence”.

Thanks to the pioneering work done by Zadeh, the fuzzy set theory has achieved considerable success over the past half century. Different variations of fuzzy set have been introduced to GDM problems, such as the intuitionistic fuzzy set, the interval-valued fuzzy set, the linguistic term set, the hesitant fuzzy set, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set, the probabilistic term set, and so forth. GDM with fuzzy information is a hot research direction in the area of decision analysis. Now and in the future, GDM methodologies and algorithms with fuzzy models would still be a quite promising research line. Given that the existing fuzzy GDM methods mainly focus on single side decision activity, the cooperative game theory is very useful to model the GDM problems in which the groups of players have competition due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior. It focuses on predicting the joint actions of the coalitions and the collective payoffs.

The more technology we have around us the more important it is to consider its contributions to problem solving and to the preservation and achievement of our existing values as well as the creation of new values. The overall purpose of the workshop is to provide multiple perspectives on the influence of technology on problem solving as well as moral, social, and/or political values.

                                                    <p class="bodytext">Technology and problem solving enhance existing needs and creates new needs. It also helps people, societies, and organizations to achieve and maintain values. The concept of “value” may be seen as a purpose or goal, here it is associated with goodness and virtue; in that sense value can be moral, social, and political. Technology is limited here to the various technical and organizational solutions that broadly fit the theme of the conference, i.e., they are related to group decisions and/or negotiations.  Broadly defined, technology is knowledge-based capability used to realize purposes/values. While all purposes/values can be introduced, emphasis in this workshop is on spiritual, moral, ethical, social and political values.

In the light of the development of new, disruptive technologies in the area of artificial intelligence AI (e.g. deep learning algorithms or natural language processing) the capabilities of artificial agents are more and more resembling those of human agents. Thus, technological solutions may become artificial moral agents that may have their own intrinsic values but also affect existing or create new human values. A problem for both, human and artificial agents arise from not realizing values. A problem solution based on technology brings realization of these values or evolved ones. Using various approaches and examples, speakers discuss values, problem solving, negotiation, leadership and technology. Speakers deliver talks followed by discussion among speakers and attendees.

                                                    <p class="bodytext">Negotiation and collaboration over water conflicts are commonly observed in real life, since conflicts are pervasive in water management when various individuals or groups having different interests interact with another. New, recently-developed negotiation methodologies and techniques that can help water managers better understand how to negotiate and collaborate to reach win/win solutions have been of great benefit to many decision makers. Novel theoretical and practical advances including Hall for Workshop of Meta-Synthetic Engineering and Consensus Decision-making have been utilized to study negotiation and collaboration over conflicts arising in water infrastructure development, water utilization, water trading and other water related management issues. The main objective of the Stream on Negotiation and Collaboration in Water Management is to provide a forum for discussion of research advances on the development of formal negotiation approaches and valuable applications in water management. Prospective authors are cordially invited to submit original research developments and applications.
